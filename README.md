# [Spaceship Titanic Competition](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/Spaceship%20Titanic%20Submission.ipynb)
This is my submission for the Spaceship Titanic Competition (competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview)). I performed some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a wide range of models with hyperparameter tuning to maximize accuracy. As of July 3rd, 2023; I've achieved an accuracy of 80.78%, placing in the top 13%.
