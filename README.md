# Kaggle Competitions
This contains my submissions for all the Kaggle competitions.

# [Spaceship Titanic Competition](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/Spaceship%20Titanic%20Submission.ipynb)
This is my submission for the Spaceship Titanic Competition (competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview)). I performed some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a wide range of models with hyperparameter tuning to maximize accuracy. As of July 3rd, 2023; I've achieved an accuracy of 80.78%, placing in the top 13%.

# [House Prices Advanced Regression Competition](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/House%20Prices%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques.ipynb)
This is my submission for the House Prices Advanced Regression Competition (competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)). I performed some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a wide range of models with hyperparameter tuning to maximize accuracy. As of July 20th, 2023; I've achieved an RMSE of 0.12349, placing in the top 12%.

# [Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Project.ipynb)
This is my code for the breast cancer prediction dataset on Kaggle (data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/merishnasuwal/starter-breast-cancer-prediction)). Since this was meant for my nonprofit ([NWDSC](https://www.northwestdsc.com/)) and complete begginers in AI, I kept the implementations very simple. But, also, I chose this project to expose the research applications of AI to the students. To read a more in-depth explanation behind my code, read my blog post [here]().
